# Design Patterns

Working through and studying design patterns.

Any code in folders named `RefactoringGuru/` has been taken from
[refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru) - an amazing site for learning
design patterns in a multitude of languages.

## Building, Formatting, and Testing

To build `DesignPatterns` from source, clone the repo. Then:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

The build script will run a formatting check with
[Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Or, run the check alone with:

```
$ npm run check
```

Use Prettier to fix formatting issues with:

```
$ npm run fix
```
